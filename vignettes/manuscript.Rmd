## Introduction

This vignette serves the purpose to reproduce the results shown in the section "Real data example" of the manuscript describing *collaborative graphical lasso*. The computations carried out by the following code are heavy and could take a considerable amount of time. On our machine it took almost 3 hours. Hence, we refer the user who wants to get started with the package to the introductory vignette: `vignette("coglasso")`. *Collaborative graphical lasso* is an algorithm to reconstruct multi-omics networks based on *graphical lasso* ([Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani, 2008](#ref)) and *collaborative regression* ([Gross and Tibshirani, 2015](#ref)). The coglasso package implements and R interface to this algorithm. We will use it to reproduce the results obtained in the original manuscript.

Let us first attach coglasso.

```{r setup}
library(coglasso)
```

We will use the multi-omics data set provided by the package, in its largest version: `multi_omics_sd`. Let's inspect its description in the manual.

```{r}
help(multi_omics_sd)
```

We notice that this data set has 162 transcripts and 76 metabolites. For further information on the data set sources and generation, we refer the user to the script [multi_omics_sd.R](https://github.com/DrQuestion/coglasso/blob/main/data-raw/multi_omics_sd.R) on the GitHub repository of the package.

## Reproducing the results

For the multi-omics network reconstruction carried out in the manuscript we explored 30 automatically generated $λ_w$ and $λ_b$ values and 10 given $c$ values.

```{r}
nlambda_w <- 30
nlambda_b <- 30
cs <- c(0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 100)
```

We can now build the networks, one per combination of the chosen hyperparameters, with `coglasso()`.

```{r}
cg <- coglasso(multi_omics_sd,
  pX = 162,
  nlambda_w = nlambda_w,
  nlambda_b = nlambda_b,
  c = cs
)
```

We proceed now to select the most stable, yet sparse network, using an adaptation to coglasso of *StARS* ([Liu, Roeder and Wasserman, 2010](#ref)). The function implementing this adapted version is `stars_coglasso()`.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
sel_cg <- stars_coglasso(cg)
```

We display now the selected network using the package `igraph`, reproducing the one displayed in Figure 3 of the manuscript. The orientation of the network may vary.

```{r}
# To create the igraph object from the selected adjacency matrix:
sel_graph <- igraph::graph.adjacency(sel_cg$sel_adj, mode = "undirected")

# Setting some graphical parameters and removing disconnected nodes from the graph
igraph::V(sel_graph)$label <- NA
igraph::V(sel_graph)$color <- c(rep("#00ccff", 162), rep("#ff9999", 76))
igraph::V(sel_graph)$frame.color <- c(rep("#002060", 162), rep("#800000", 76))
igraph::V(sel_graph)$frame.width <- 2
igraph::V(sel_graph)$size <- 4
igraph::E(sel_graph)$width <- 0.3

lo <- igraph::layout_with_fr(sel_graph)
diconnected <- which(igraph::degree(sel_graph) == 0)
sel_graph2 <- igraph::delete.vertices(sel_graph, diconnected)
lo2 <- lo[-diconnected, ]

# Plotting
plot(sel_graph2, layout = lo2)
```

We now plot the subnetwork of the gene *Cirbp* and of its neighborhood. This reproduces Figure 4.

```{r}
cirbp_index <- which(colnames(sel_cg$data) == "Cirbp")
subnetwork <- igraph::subgraph(
  sel_graph,
  c(cirbp_index, igraph::neighbors(sel_graph, cirbp_index))
)
plot(subnetwork)
```
